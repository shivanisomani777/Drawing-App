# Drawing-App
This mini project is an interactive drawing app crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can freely sketch, adjust the brush size up to 50, and select any RGB color shade. With a simple click, they can clear the canvas entirely. It offers a fun and intuitive way to unleash creativity and explore various color options while drawing.
